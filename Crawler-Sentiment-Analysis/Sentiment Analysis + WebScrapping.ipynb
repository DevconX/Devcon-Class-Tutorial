       "\"This film is on my list of worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions. All films need to have an inner logic, and this film just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make any sense. <br /><br />To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland must be an amazing actor because he manages to look good in spite of bad directing and bad writing; his performance is believable and he manages to stay in character in spite of everything. <br /><br />If Dame Agatha Christie were alive she would die laughing! The movie is that bad!\""

Character development is so basic, that, except for their ages, you'd have a hard time telling the kids from the adults. Everyone, except the dinosaurs are void of personality. When the creatures aren't on the screen, you're subjected to a screenplay that features dull, one-dimensional characters spouting boring dialog. Steven Spielberg seems to have lost his ability to direct a film, that grips an audience with its storytelling (Duel, Jaws, Close Encounters).
